## About

We built a framework for executing background scripts and Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey scripts based on the design ideas of Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey. It also has several unique APIs that enable scripts to do more. Furthermore, we provide a fantastic online editor that makes script code development more pleasant and easy.

**Please Star it if you find it useful. ❤❤❤**

## Instructions

### Install script

You can get normal userscripts from [major userscript markets](https://docs.scriptcat.org/docs/use/#%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96%E8%84%9A%E6%9C%AC) and background scripts from [Background Scripts](https://bbs.tampermonkey.net.cn/forum-68-1.html) which is supported by ScriptCat.

The installation method is the same as Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey, and it is also compatible with the majority of userscripts. If you encounter any incompatible scripts, you can provide feedback to us through [issues](https://github.com/scriptscat/scriptcat/issues).

### Script development documentation

The [Documentation](https://docs.scriptcat.org/docs/dev/) is trying its best to improve. Because it refers to the design of Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey, there are many similarities with their scripts. Even if you use other script managers, You can also refer to the documentation of ScriptCat to develop!
